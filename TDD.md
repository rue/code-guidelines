## Philosophy
 Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.
## Available TDD documentations
## Theory
### Test-First
 You first start by writing a test that best describe the use case of your business.
 This step is really important because it forces you to change your default mindset ).
 You to focus on real business use cases and object interfaces and api instead of mere implementations.
 
 - Your write a failing test (really important, it helps you to avoir false positives)
 - You write as least code as possible to make the test pass
 - You refactor your code.
 - Repeat till the end of time.
